# CSC-340-Database-Design-Project
Designed a database for a client in real-life. Specifically, it was for a food distributor company, Champion Food Services 2 in San Antonio, Texas.

### How this project was designed
I first wrote a report to clarify what the client wanted us to input into their database. The design report serves as a reference to understand the functions and assets of their business. I then created an ER (Entity Relationship) diagram to create a visual representation of the database we were making. And to turn this into schemas, algorithms including the 8-step algorithm, normalization, and canonical cover were used. 

After finalizing the schemas, I then defined the tables which are in the sql-dump. To ensure these databases work as intended, I created a list of simple and complex queries.
